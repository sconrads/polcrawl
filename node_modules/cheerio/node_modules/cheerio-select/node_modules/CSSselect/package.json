When searching for elements, testing is executed \"from the top\", similar to how browsers execute CSS selectors.\n\nIn it's default configuration, CSSselect provides functions to query the DOM produced by the [`domhandler`](https://github.com/fb55/domhandler) module.\n\n##Why?\n\nThe common approach of executing CSS selectors (used eg. by [`Sizzle`](https://github.com/jquery/sizzle), [`nwmatcher`](https://github.com/dperini/nwmatcher/) and [`qwery`](https://github.com/ded/qwery)) is to execute every component of the selector in order, from left to right. The selector `a b` for example will first look for `a` elements, then search these for `b` elements.\n\nWhile this works, it has some downsides: Children of `a`s will be checked multiple times, first, to check if they are also `a`s, then, for every superior `a` once, if they are `b`s. Using [Big O notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), that would be `O(n^2)`.\n\nThe far more efficient approach is to first look for `b` elements, then check if they have superior `a` elements: Using big O notation again, that would be `O(n)`.\n\nAnd that's exactly what CSSselect does.\n\n##How?\n\nBy stacking functions!\n\n_//TODO: Better explanation (for now, if you're interested, have a look at the source code)_\n\n##API\n\n```js\nvar CSSselect = require(\"CSSselect\");\n```\n\n####`CSSselect(query[, elems])`\n\nCompiles the query. If `elems` is specified, it's queried and the result is returned. Otherwise, the function is returned.\n\n(Note: This is a pretty awful API. Don't use it. Will be changed.)\n\n####`CSSselect.parse(query)`\n\nCompiles the query, returns the function.\n\n(Note: Will be renamed to `compile`, but `parse` stays an alias.)\n\n####`CSSselect.is(elem, query)`\n\nTests whether or not an element is matched by `query`. `query` can be either a CSS selector or a function.\n\n####`CSSselect.iterate(query, elems)`\n\nTraverses `elems` (or, if `elems` is only a single element, its children) and returns all elements that match `query`. Once again, `query` can be either a CSS selector or a function.\n\n---\n\nLicense: BSD-like\n",
